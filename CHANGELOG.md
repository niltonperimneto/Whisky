# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- An unreadable bottle registry no longer silently wipes the bottle list. On
  startup the corrupt file is moved aside (an alert says where) and, when the
  file is in the older paths-only fallback format, the bottle paths are
  recovered instead of being overwritten with an empty list (Refs #61).
- Bottle creation now fails loudly when the new bottle can't be saved to the
  registry: the save is verified on disk and the existing failure alert (with
  copyable diagnostics) fires. Previously the error case existed but was never
  raised, so the bottle silently vanished on the next launch (Refs #61).
- Creating a bottle while the Wine runtime (WhiskyWine) isn't installed now
  shows a clear "runtime missing" error with a Run Setup button instead of a
  low-level file-not-found failure (Refs #61).
- The Winetricks button now shows an error when the bundled winetricks
  resources can't be found, instead of silently doing nothing (Refs #134).

## [3.5.1] - 2026-07-24 (App)

### Fixed
- Installing bottle dependencies (VC++, .NET, DirectX, fonts) and the Winetricks
  verb browser now work out of the box. `winetricks` was expected inside the
  downloaded Wine runtime but was never shipped there, so dependency installs
  failed with a missing-file error and the verb list showed empty. `winetricks`
  (and its verb catalog) are now bundled in the app itself, so they work on a
  clean install with no extra setup (Closes #134).

## [3.5.0] - 2026-06-14 (App)

### Added
- Bottle configuration options now carry inline descriptions explaining what
  they do. The Wine section (Windows version, build, enhanced sync, DPI, Retina
  mode) and the DXVK section (DXVK, async, HUD) previously had no explanation;
  each now shows a one-line caption so you can make an informed choice without
  hunting through docs (Closes whisky-app/whisky#807).
- Optional menu-bar extra (**Settings → General → "Show Whisky in the menu
  bar"**, off by default). When enabled, a menu-bar item lets you launch a
  bottle's pinned programs, reopen Whisky, or quit without the main window
  focused — and Whisky keeps running after the window is closed, so it stays
  reachable from the menu bar and running Wine processes aren't terminated.
  When disabled, behaviour is unchanged (Closes whisky-app/whisky#571).

### Changed
- Scanning a bottle for installed programs now runs off the main thread —
  walking the `Program Files` trees and parsing each executable's metadata no
  longer blocks the UI, so opening or switching to a bottle with many installed
  programs no longer hitches. The programs list shows a progress indicator while
  the scan runs (Closes whisky-app/whisky#574).
- Update checks are now gentler: a scheduled background check that finds a new
  version no longer interrupts you with a focus-stealing dialog. Instead a Dock
  badge appears and the "Check for Updates" menu item reads "Install Update…",
  so you can apply it when ready. User-initiated checks and the install itself
  are unchanged (Closes whisky-app/whisky#765).

## [3.4.0] - 2026-06-13 (App)

### Added
- DXMT (Direct3D 11 → Metal) as a selectable per-bottle and per-program
  graphics backend, marked Experimental. Deployed per-bottle like DXVK
  (native DLLs in the prefix), so selecting it for one bottle never affects
  others. Requires the matching Wine runtime that bundles the DXMT backend
  (shipped alongside this release); the backend card explains how to update
  when it's unavailable. D3DMetal remains the recommended default.

### Fixed
- Per-program graphics overrides now reliably win over the bottle's
  setting: the override UI's legacy DXVK flag could silently re-enable or
  disable the wrong translation layer when an explicit backend was chosen
  for a program.
- Installing or updating the Wine runtime no longer erases the rest of
  Whisky's Application Support folder. Previously the installer wiped the
  whole folder instead of just the runtime, destroying unrelated app state —
  including the telemetry queue and anonymous ID, which is why a completed
  install could go missing from the opt-in funnel.
- A launch error for a Windows program opened from Finder is no longer
  silently swallowed — it now surfaces as an error notification instead of
  only being logged while the dialog closes.

### Changed
- Wine runtime updated to Libraries v3.1.1, which ships DXMT 0.80 as the
  native per-bottle backend (see Added). Wine 11.0 and DXVK 1.10.3 are
  unchanged from the previous runtime.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-06-11 (App)

### Added
- Optional, **opt-in** anonymous usage telemetry. A checkbox during first-run
  setup (off by default, changeable anytime in Settings → Privacy) enables five
  anonymous events covering the first-run funnel — runtime install
  started/succeeded/failed (with a coarse reason), first bottle created, first
  program launch attempted — so install failures in the field become visible.
  The first-program-launch event now fires from both the programs list and a
  program's detail view, so no real launch path is missed. Nothing is sent
  without explicit consent; no person profile is created, and no personal data,
  paths, or raw error text is ever included. The full event list, the SDK context
  that accompanies it, and the IP/GeoIP handling are documented in the README and
  SECURITY.md.

### Fixed
- The first-run telemetry opt-in is now always reachable: when the Wine runtime
  is missing, setup no longer skips straight past the welcome screen (the only
  place the consent checkbox lives) before you can make a choice.
- Bottle and per-program settings are now written atomically, so a crash
  mid-save can no longer leave a truncated settings file that wipes the
  configuration.
- Every persisted settings choice — graphics backend, performance and resolution
  presets, Windows version, launcher mode/type/locale and spoofed GPU vendor,
  audio driver/latency/output mode, clipboard and process-cleanup policies, and
  the per-program equivalents — now tolerates an unknown value written by a newer
  Whisky. A single unrecognized choice falls back to its default (per-program
  overrides fall back to inheriting the bottle's choice) instead of failing to
  load the entire bottle's settings.
- An unreadable settings file is no longer silently overwritten. When a bottle's
  `Metadata.plist` or a program's settings plist can't be decoded (corruption or
  an unexpected file version), the original is moved aside to a
  `.corrupt-<timestamp>` sibling before defaults are written, so the unreadable
  data is preserved for recovery rather than destroyed.
- Closed several crash vectors when opening a Windows executable with crafted or
  corrupt headers during icon extraction (also reached by the Finder thumbnail
  extension): overflow traps in resource-offset math, unbounded recursion on
  circular or pathologically deep resource directories, and header reads
  straddling the end of a truncated file. Resource offsets are now resolved with
  overflow-checked math, the directory walk is depth-capped, and short reads are
  rejected instead of loading past the buffer.
- Hardened icon and thumbnail extraction against crafted executables that could
  previously hang the parser or render garbage: resource directory entry counts
  are clamped to the file size, the whole resource walk shares a total-entry
  budget so fan-out can't amplify, and icon bitmap dimensions and palette lengths
  are validated before reading pixels. An executable with no usable icon now
  falls back to a generic system icon instead of showing a blank tile.
- The "Failed to Export Diagnostics Report" alert is now localizable instead of
  English-only, matching the rest of the launcher diagnostics UI.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-06-10 (App)

### Added
- The Wine runtime download is now verified against a published SHA-256 before
  installation. A corrupted or truncated download is caught and rejected with a
  clear error and a retry, instead of unpacking a broken runtime. Runtime
  metadata that predates the published checksum still installs unchanged.

### Fixed
- Bottle creation now validates the chosen location before doing any work: if
  the folder isn't writable or the disk is nearly full, you get a clear,
  actionable error up front instead of the bottle silently disappearing after a
  cryptic Wine failure. Builds on the bottle-creation diagnostics added for
  issue #61.
- Runtime installation failures now surface their cause. `install(from:)`
  propagates the underlying error (missing tarball, disk full, archive
  extraction failure) instead of swallowing it, so the setup screen shows the
  specific reason and the diagnostics report captures it.
- A half-installed Wine runtime is no longer mistaken for a working one. The
  install check now requires the `wine64` binary on disk, not just the version
  file, so a partial extraction or removal prompts a clean re-install instead of
  leaving every bottle to fail with cryptic Wine errors.
- Bottle-creation error messages are now localizable instead of English-only,
  so non-English users see translated text when creation fails.

### Documentation
- Landing page (`frankea.github.io/Whisky`) now shows app screenshots, adds an
  honest "Graphics backends" section (D3DMetal default, why DXVK is pinned at
  1.10.3 by design, and the Wine-wide anti-cheat limitation), and bumps the
  advertised version to 3.1.0.
- Replaced the dead "Game Support wiki" links (the wiki page bounced to the repo
  root) across the README, landing page, and issue templates with the bundled
  Game Configurations database.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-06-08 (App)

### Added
- **File → Migrate from the Original Whisky** discovers bottles created by the
  archived original app (`com.isaacmarovitz.Whisky`) and imports them in one
  step, with checkboxes to choose which. Bottles are referenced in place —
  nothing is moved or copied — so the import is non-destructive and the original
  app keeps working, replacing the previous manual export/import dance.
- Bottle creation now copies host fonts (Arial Unicode, Arial, Tahoma) into
  `drive_c/windows/Fonts` so Unity titles render fallback glyphs instead of
  empty boxes (Closes whisky-app/whisky#1050).
- File pickers for "Run" and "Pin Program" now accept `.msix`, `.appx`,
  `.appref-ms`, and `.url` files in addition to `.exe`/`.msi`/`.bat`. Steam
  desktop shortcuts (`.url`) launch correctly via Wine's `start` handler
  (Closes whisky-app/whisky#756, whisky-app/whisky#815, whisky-app/whisky#826).
- Winetricks verb browser is searchable: filter the verb table by name or
  description (Closes whisky-app/whisky#763).
- Wine inherits the host timezone (`TZ`) so games keying off date/time render
  correctly instead of treating the bottle as UTC
  (Closes whisky-app/whisky#1001).
- PE icon extraction returns a generic Windows-executable system icon when
  parsing fails, so program tiles and pins never render blank
  (Closes whisky-app/whisky#687).
- Display sleep / screen saver is now suppressed via an `IOPMAssertion` for
  as long as any Wine process is registered. Controllers don't generate user
  activity events on macOS, so without this, gaming with only a controller
  would still trigger the screen saver
  (Closes whisky-app/whisky#547).
- Bundled GameDB ships 29 new per-game entries with curated configs that
  GAME-02/GAME-03 surface as one-click recommendations:
  - Diablo IV, Skyrim Special Edition, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine
    (Closes whisky-app/whisky#813, whisky-app/whisky#1125, whisky-app/whisky#1246).
  - AVX-off recipes for Granblue Fantasy: Relink, Turtle WoW
    (Closes whisky-app/whisky#508, whisky-app/whisky#805).
  - DXVK + runtime recipes for Age of Empires II DE, Bannerlord II,
    Warframe, Thunderstore Mod Manager, Animal Well, Supermarket Together,
    Talos Principle 2, Street Fighter 6, PS Plus PC App, Fields of Mistria,
    Horizon Forbidden West, Injustice 2, Monster Hunter Wilds, Trackmania
    2020, Trackmania Nations Forever, Team Fortress 2, Potion Craft,
    TMNT: Shredder's Revenge, Assetto Corsa, Futureport 82
    (Closes whisky-app/whisky#314, whisky-app/whisky#524, whisky-app/whisky#548,
    whisky-app/whisky#594, whisky-app/whisky#647, whisky-app/whisky#679,
    whisky-app/whisky#699, whisky-app/whisky#757, whisky-app/whisky#769,
    whisky-app/whisky#782, whisky-app/whisky#845, whisky-app/whisky#867,
    whisky-app/whisky#880, whisky-app/whisky#891, whisky-app/whisky#982,
    whisky-app/whisky#1026, whisky-app/whisky#1037, whisky-app/whisky#1105,
    whisky-app/whisky#1192, whisky-app/whisky#1236, whisky-app/whisky#1281,
    whisky-app/whisky#1350).
  - D3DMetal-preferred recipe for Among Us (DXVK shadow glitch)
    (Closes whisky-app/whisky#1123).
  - "Broken/unplayable" entries for Cities: Skylines II and Metal Gear Solid
    Master Collection Vol. 1 with diagnostic notes
    (Closes whisky-app/whisky#1032, whisky-app/whisky#1268).
  - Classic-DDraw recipe (wineD3D + WinXP) for Zuma Deluxe
    (Closes whisky-app/whisky#484).
- Input config gains "Map Command Key to Windows Ctrl" toggle (under
  Controller Compatibility Mode). Writes
  `HKCU\Software\Wine\Mac Driver\{Left,Right}CommandIsCtrl` so common
  Cmd+A/C/V/S keystrokes register inside Wine apps as Ctrl+A/C/V/S
  (Closes whisky-app/whisky#1060).
- Setup/Welcome view's "Uninstall" button now offers two options: remove the
  WhiskyWine runtime only (preserves bottles for later reinstall) or remove
  everything (runtime + default bottles directory + BottleData registry).
  Bottles at custom paths outside the default directory are preserved
  (Closes whisky-app/whisky#411).
- The bundled DXVK version is now tracked alongside the runtime version. The
  WhiskyWine version record carries an optional `dxvkVersion`, and the setup
  diagnostics report gained a `[VERSION]` section listing the installed runtime
  and DXVK versions to speed up triage of runtime-mismatch issues. The field is
  backward-compatible: runtime plists without it still load.

### Changed
- Diagnostic reports (WhiskyWine setup and Wine prefix) now link to this fork's issue tracker
  (`frankea/Whisky`) instead of the archived upstream, so reports reach a maintained repo. Internal
  Logger subsystems and notification names also moved off the archived `com.isaacmarovitz.Whisky`
  namespace onto `com.franke.Whisky`.
- Bundled GameDB grows by 4 more entries from the third-pass retriage:
  DJMAX RESPECT V (Korean fonts + DXVK), They Are Billions (vcrun + DXVK),
  SpellForce 3 (corefonts + d3dcompiler), Fallout 4 (Sequoia compat + xact)
  (Closes whisky-app/whisky#748, whisky-app/whisky#890,
  whisky-app/whisky#980, whisky-app/whisky#1312).
- Bundled GameDB gains 20 more entries from the fourth-pass retriage —
  full coverage of the long tail of mainstream titles in the upstream
  backlog: Jusant, Ready or Not, Persona 3 Reload, Binding of Isaac,
  Trackmania Turbo, It Takes Two, Tales of Berseria, Cobalt Core,
  Psychonauts 2, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, killer7, Train Sim World 5,
  Black Mesa, Far Cry 4, Severed Steel, Halo: Master Chief Collection,
  Mortal Kombat Komplete Edition, YS X: Nordics, Slime Rancher 2,
  Monster Hunter: World (Iceborne) (Closes whisky-app/whisky#279,
  whisky-app/whisky#631, whisky-app/whisky#694, whisky-app/whisky#727,
  whisky-app/whisky#829, whisky-app/whisky#1025, whisky-app/whisky#1108,
  whisky-app/whisky#1119, whisky-app/whisky#1124, whisky-app/whisky#1137,
  whisky-app/whisky#1157, whisky-app/whisky#1160, whisky-app/whisky#1162,
  whisky-app/whisky#1180, whisky-app/whisky#1190, whisky-app/whisky#1208,
  whisky-app/whisky#1214, whisky-app/whisky#1235, whisky-app/whisky#1258,
  whisky-app/whisky#1320). The bundled DB now covers 79 titles.
- Diagnostic system-info reports use sysctl-based hardware detection
  (`hw.optional.arm64`) instead of the `#if arch(arm64)` compile-time
  macro, so a universal binary running its x86_64 slice through Rosetta
  no longer misreports the host as Intel
  (Closes whisky-app/whisky#1097).
- Installed-programs list filters out known launcher helpers and crash
  reporters (steamerrorreporter, steamservice, steamwebhelper, GameOverlayUI,
  vc_redist, UEPrereqSetup, the CrossOver HTML engine helper, etc.) so the
  visible list stays clean by default while leaving the user blocklist for
  app-specific filtering
  (Closes whisky-app/whisky#432, whisky-app/whisky#1215).
- WhiskyWine download survives transient Wi-Fi/Ethernet/VPN disconnects via
  `waitsForConnectivity` and bounded request/resource timeouts so a stalled
  download surfaces an error instead of hanging forever
  (Closes whisky-app/whisky#293, whisky-app/whisky#995, whisky-app/whisky#1020, whisky-app/whisky#1070).

### Fixed
- Wine no longer pegs a CPU core when a running process goes quiet. After a
  process closed its stdout/stderr but kept running, the pipe's readability
  handler fired continuously on the permanently-readable EOF condition. The
  handler now removes itself on EOF (the final bytes are still drained when the
  process exits), so an idle Wine process no longer spins
  (Closes whisky-app/whisky#917, whisky-app/whisky#1010).
- Moving a bottle no longer wipes its pinned-program list. The `move()` loop
  was shadowing the bottle's `url` with `pin.url`, causing
  `updateParentBottle` to compare a pin path against itself instead of the
  bottle root. Pin paths are now correctly rewritten to point at the new
  bottle location (Closes whisky-app/whisky#830).
- Right-click "Add to blocklist" no longer creates duplicate entries. The
  context-menu actions dedupe against the existing blocklist before
  appending, both for single-row and multi-selection cases
  (Closes whisky-app/whisky#431).
- DXVK installation no longer stops short when the bundle directory contains a
  non-DLL file. The copy loop returned on the first non-`.dll` entry (e.g. a
  stray `.DS_Store`), which could leave some DXVK DLLs uninstalled; it now skips
  non-DLL entries and continues.
- Pinning start-menu programs no longer stops at the first already-pinned entry.
  The pin loop returned early once it found a program already in the pin list,
  leaving every subsequent start-menu program unpinned; it now skips that entry
  and continues processing the rest.

### Documentation
- Added project governance and support docs: `docs/GOVERNANCE.md` (honest single-maintainer
  continuity stance), `docs/SUPPORT.md` (where to file and what to expect), and
  `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md` (pinned Wine/DXVK/D3DMetal/DXMT runtime components and their sources).
- Documented the reproducible runtime-assembly procedure in `docs/ReleaseWorkflow.md` (previously
  marked "out of scope") and added a weekly `RuntimeTrack` workflow that flags when a bundled runtime
  component falls behind upstream. The bug-report template now asks reporters to confirm they're on
  this fork rather than the archived original.
- `SECURITY.md` now documents how Wine/DXVK runtime vulnerabilities are handled — pinned versions are
  tracked against upstream, and a critical bundled-component CVE triggers an out-of-band runtime rebuild
  and release. Added `FUNDING.md` describing the volunteer, single-maintainer sustainability model.
- Removed the inherited CrossOver affiliate links (`ad=1010`) from the README and funding config; this
  fork has no affiliate or revenue-sharing arrangement, and those links credited the original project.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-05-01 (App)

### Fixed
- WhiskyWine install hung at "Installing WhiskyWine — Almost there" because
  `Tar.validateArchivePaths` waited for the `tar -tvzf` process to exit before
  reading its stdout pipe. With the 313 MB Wine Libraries archive the verbose
  listing easily exceeds the pipe buffer, so tar blocked writing while Whisky
  waited for it to finish — a classic pipe deadlock. The pipe is now drained
  before `waitUntilExit`.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-05-01 (App)
