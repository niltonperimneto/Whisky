/// names a target the same way a URL does, an installed Steam app ID or a pin
/// the user made, and resolves it at launch time rather than baking a path. A
/// shortcut therefore survives its bottle being moved or renamed, and picks up
/// current settings, DLL deployment and crash classification, because it goes
/// through the same door as a launch from the window. Anything added later that
/// starts a program from outside the window belongs here, resolving the same
/// two identifiers, rather than growing its own path handling. Why a URL may
/// only ever name those two things is ``WhiskyKit/WhiskyURL``.
