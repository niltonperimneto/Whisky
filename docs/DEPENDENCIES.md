# Runtime dependencies

Whisky's app code is built from this repo, but the **Wine runtime** it downloads on first launch
(`Libraries.tar.gz`) is assembled from third-party binaries. This file is the single source of truth
for *what versions are bundled* and *where they come from*, so the runtime can't silently go stale and
any future maintainer can reproduce a build. Update it whenever a runtime release is cut.

> The authoritative version and digest are in
> [`dist/pages/WhiskyWineVersion.plist`](../dist/pages/WhiskyWineVersion.plist), the file the app
> reads. If this file and that plist disagree, the plist is right and this file is stale.

See [`ReleaseWorkflow.md`](ReleaseWorkflow.md) for the assembly + publish procedure, and
[`.github/workflows/RuntimeTrack.yml`](../.github/workflows/RuntimeTrack.yml) for the automation that
flags when a bundled component falls behind upstream.

## Bundled in runtime `4.5.114`

| Component | Bundled version | Upstream source | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Wine** | 11.14 | [dappermint/winecx-gptk](https://github.com/dappermint/winecx-gptk) | This fork builds it rather than repacking someone else's, because the GPTK route needs a Wine that calls personality routines in builtin modules. The runtime version's last component tracks the Wine minor: `4.5.114` is Wine 11.14, the current upstream development release. |
| **DXVK (macOS)** | 1.10.3 | [Gcenx/DXVK-macOS](https://github.com/Gcenx/DXVK-macOS/releases) | Frozen at 1.10.x **by design** — the DXVK 2.x line needs Vulkan 1.3 features MoltenVK/macOS don't expose. Not stale; do not "upgrade" to upstream 2.x. |
| **DXMT** | 0.80 | [3Shain/dxmt](https://github.com/3Shain/dxmt/releases) | Direct3D 11 → Metal. Bundled from the project's prebuilt v0.80 release — the **last MIT-licensed** build (v1.0+ is LGPL; bumping past 0.80 is a deliberate relicensing decision, not routine drift). The release ships only the `wine_builtin_dll=true` asset (trio carries winebuild's "Wine builtin DLL" header marker, meant for a *global* `lib/wine` install). For **per-bottle** selection, `scripts/assemble-runtime.sh` strips that marker from `d3d11`/`dxgi`/`d3d10core` (x64+x32) — deterministically reproducing the project's `wine_builtin_dll=false` (native) variant — and stages them in `Libraries/DXMT/{x64,x32}`. The app then copies the native trio into each bottle's `system32`/`syswow64` with `dxgi,d3d11,d3d10core=n,b`, exactly like DXVK. `winemetal` stays a builtin: its `winemetal.dll` is synced into both Wine windows trees (paired with `winemetal.so` in the unix tree) and the app copies it into the prefix as the import redirect. Selectable per-bottle/per-program in app ≥ 3.4.0 (Experimental); requires a runtime assembled by the current script (the older builtin-variant payload is gated off, since it would silently redirect to wined3d). |
| **D3DMetal** | from Apple Game Porting Toolkit | [Apple GPTK](https://developer.apple.com/games/game-porting-toolkit/) | **Apple-proprietary. Extracted, never built.** Redistribution is governed by Apple's GPTK license — review terms before bumping. Not bundled in the published runtime; used only when a GPTK payload is present on disk. Since app 3.5.2 the "Recommended" backend resolves to DXMT (or DXVK) when the payload is absent, and the picker greys D3DMetal out rather than offering a silent wined3d fallback. |
| **MoltenVK** | (confirm against published archive) | [KhronosGroup/MoltenVK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/releases) | Vulkan→Metal; underpins the DXVK path. |
| **msync** | (confirm against published archive) | [marzent/wine-msync](https://github.com/marzent/wine-msync) | Mach-based synchronization patch in the Gcenx build. |

> The exact MoltenVK/msync versions live inside the published `Libraries.tar.gz`, not this repo. When
> you cut a runtime release, read them off the build and fill them in here so this table is authoritative.

### Archive integrity

| Artifact | SHA-256 |
|----------|---------|
| `Libraries.tar.gz` (`4.5.114`) | `e7e3f28d6475c4e65617556d8d30e850f77a7b0abb2fc94685b8a36e6a368419` |
| `Libraries.tar.gz` (`v3.1.1`) | `01f3a1b43b98065fe20c529c1023b61dd79a6d2ad93bba6040865f646481ccf3` |
| `Libraries.tar.gz` (`v3.1.0`) | `86e2d54a60736f27e6ce82cacf2a91e500c20f6d32ae959a16afd912e6b03096` |
| `Libraries.tar.gz` (`v3.0.0`) | `9c3d2a7d9bb682ae8398d8bae458e3cb52bb9f5a3345fb0830a64d9b6a1025f8` |

The same digest is published in
[`dist/pages/WhiskyWineVersion.plist`](../dist/pages/WhiskyWineVersion.plist) under the `sha256` key.
The app verifies the downloaded archive against it before installing and **fails closed** on a
mismatch (a corrupted or truncated download is the common cause). This is an integrity check, not a
substitute for HTTPS transport trust. When cutting a runtime release, compute the digest of the exact
published asset (`shasum -a 256 Libraries.tar.gz`) and update **both** this table and the plist — an
incorrect value will block every fresh install.

## Bundled in the app

These ship **inside the app bundle** (`Whisky.app/Contents/Resources/`), committed to this repo under
[`Libraries/`](../Libraries) and copied in by the app target's "Embed WhiskyCmd" build phase. They are
**not** part of the downloaded `Libraries.tar.gz` runtime — bundling them in the app means a fix reaches
every install through a normal app update, with no runtime re-download.

| Component | Pinned version | Upstream source | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| **winetricks** | `20260125` | [Winetricks/winetricks](https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks/releases/tag/20260125) | Self-contained POSIX shell script (LGPL-2.1+). Drives dependency installs (VC++, .NET, DirectX, fonts) and verb queries. Invoked as `bash winetricks <verb>` with the bundled `cabextract` and the runtime's `Wine/bin` on `PATH`. Bump by re-fetching `src/winetricks` at a newer release tag and regenerating `verbs.txt`. |
| **verbs.txt** | generated from winetricks `20260125` | produced by `winetricks list-all` | Verb catalog shown in the Winetricks browser. Regenerate whenever winetricks is bumped: `sh Libraries/winetricks list-all` (drop the leading platform-warning line so the file starts at the first `=====` category header). |
| **cabextract** | prebuilt arm64 binary | [cabextract.org.uk](https://www.cabextract.org.uk/) | Extracts Microsoft `.cab` archives; a hard dependency of many winetricks verbs. Committed as a code-signed-on-copy Mach-O executable. |

## Tracking cadence

- **Wine:** check each January for the new stable (next: **Wine 12, ~Jan 2027**). Test before bundling.
- **Wine / DXVK-macOS / DXMT:** `RuntimeTrack.yml` polls these GitHub release feeds weekly and opens an
  issue when a bundled version is behind. Triage; bumping is a deliberate, tested decision, not automatic.
- **D3DMetal (GPTK):** Apple ships it as a Game Porting Toolkit download with no GitHub release feed, so
  it is **tracked manually** — check Apple's GPTK page when a new GPTK lands.
- **Security:** a critical Wine/DXVK CVE should trigger an out-of-band runtime rebuild + app release.
  See `SECURITY.md`.
- **winetricks:** releases roughly monthly; tracked manually (no feed in `RuntimeTrack.yml`). Bump when a
  needed verb's download URL breaks or a new component is required — it rides an app release, not a runtime one.

## Why we consume rather than build

Building and maintaining the macOS Wine runtime is the single most specialized, fragile job in this
ecosystem — it is effectively Gcenx's entire role and CodeWeavers' paid team's. On a deliberately
solo-maintained project (see [`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md)), taking that on would
*deepen* the bus-factor risk it was meant to reduce. So we consume upstream binaries and invest instead
in **discipline**: pinned versions, automated staleness detection, and a documented, reproducible assembly.
