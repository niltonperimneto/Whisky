# Support

Whisky is a community fork maintained by one person (see [`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md)). Support is
best-effort and free. This page sets honest expectations and points you at the fastest path to a fix.

## Before opening an issue

Most problems already have an answer:

1. **Know which build you're running.** Check **Whisky → About**. There are three:
   - `brew install --cask whisky` is the **archived original** (last updated April 2025). Bugs in it
     can't be fixed anywhere.
   - `brew install --cask frankea/whisky/whisky`, or the DMG from
     [Releases](https://github.com/frankea/Whisky/releases/latest), is the maintained app. Issues
     about it belong on that tracker.
   - `brew install --cask dappermint/tap/whisky-preview` is **Whisky Preview**, a personal fork
     numbered by calendar date rather than upstream's semver. It has no issue tracker. Reproduce
     the problem on the maintained app above before reporting it, and if it only happens on
     Preview, take it to the fork's maintainer rather than upstream's tracker.
2. **Search [existing issues](https://github.com/frankea/Whisky/issues?q=is%3Aissue).**
3. **Check the troubleshooting docs:**
   [Launcher](LauncherTroubleshooting.md) · [Steam](SteamCompatibility.md) · [Stability](StabilityTroubleshooting.md).
4. **For a specific game**, check the [Game Support wiki](https://github.com/frankea/Whisky/wiki/Game-Support)
   and use the **Game Compatibility Report** template.

## Where to go

| You have… | Go to |
|-----------|-------|
| A reproducible app bug | [New issue → Bug Report](https://github.com/frankea/Whisky/issues/new/choose) |
| A game that won't run right | [New issue → Game Compatibility Report](https://github.com/frankea/Whisky/issues/new/choose) |
| An idea | [New issue → Feature Request](https://github.com/frankea/Whisky/issues/new/choose) |
| A security report | See [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) — **do not** open a public issue |
| A "how do I…" question | The troubleshooting docs and the Game Support wiki first |

**Do not open issues on the archived [whisky-app/whisky](https://github.com/whisky-app/whisky) repo** —
it is read-only and no one will see them.

## What to expect

This is a volunteer, single-maintainer project, so please calibrate accordingly:

- **Triage:** new issues are looked at as time allows — think days-to-weeks, not hours. There is no SLA.
- **A good report gets a faster fix.** Always include: Whisky version (**Whisky → About**), macOS
  version, the graphics backend, and — for crashes/freezes — the diagnostic export from
  **Bottle Configuration → View Diagnostics**. Reports missing these usually stall waiting on info.
- **Wine-layer limits:** Whisky configures and wraps Wine; it can't patch Wine itself. Some
  incompatibilities (anti-cheat, kernel drivers, and certain OS-version regressions) are genuinely
  outside what this app can fix — those get documented rather than "fixed."
- **English, please:** so any maintainer or contributor can read and act on the report.
