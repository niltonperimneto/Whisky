# Roadmap: Whisky Upstream Issue Resolution

## Overview

This roadmap delivers systematic resolution of 435+ upstream issues across 10 phases, starting with in-progress miscellaneous fixes and building through configuration foundation, graphics/audio/process management features, game compatibility, platform-specific fixes, and culminating in an integrated guided troubleshooting system. The configuration foundation (Phase 2) is the critical enabler: graphics, audio, game compatibility, and troubleshooting all depend on a clean environment variable cascade. Phases 3-4 (Process Lifecycle and Graphics Config) are parallel-capable after the foundation is in place.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Miscellaneous Fixes
**Goal**: In-progress PR #79 work is complete, delivering ClickOnce support, clipboard safety, temp file cleanup, and basic process resource management
**Depends on**: Nothing (in-progress work, close first)
**Requirements**: MISC-01, MISC-02, MISC-03, MISC-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. ClickOnce applications can be deployed and managed within Whisky bottles
  2. Multiplayer games with rapid clipboard access (e.g., Risk of Rain 2) no longer trigger UI freezes
  3. Temporary files are automatically cleaned up when a bottle is closed or Whisky quits
  4. Zombie Wine processes do not accumulate after programs exit
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md -- WhiskyKit backend: fix ClickOnce username, refactor ClipboardManager result pattern, add per-bottle cleanup settings
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md -- ClickOnce UI: surface apps in Programs list with badge, context menu, auto-detection
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md -- Clipboard + lifecycle wiring: pre-launch clipboard check, temp file tracking, AppDelegate cleanup hooks, ConfigView settings

### Phase 2: Configuration Foundation
**Goal**: Environment variable cascade is explicit, conflict-free, and extensible so all downstream configuration features (graphics, audio, game profiles) build on a stable base
**Depends on**: Nothing (foundation work)
**Requirements**: CFGF-01, CFGF-02, CFGF-03, CFGF-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Environment variable precedence across all layers (Wine defaults, macOS fixes, bottle settings, launcher presets, game profiles, program settings, user overrides) is enforced by a single EnvironmentBuilder with documented layer ordering
  2. Programs can have per-program DLL override entries (WINEDLLOVERRIDES) that take effect at launch
  3. Programs track which winetricks verbs have been applied, visible in program settings
  4. No conflicting merge strategies exist between MacOSCompatibility, BottleSettings, and LauncherPresets -- a single code path resolves all layers
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md -- Core data models: EnvironmentBuilder, DLL override resolver, ProgramOverrides (TDD)
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md -- Refactor environment construction to EnvironmentBuilder with 8-layer resolution
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md -- Winetricks verb tracking: cache, discovery, and WinetricksView installed filter
- [x] 02-04-PLAN.md -- DLL override editor UI and per-program override settings

### Phase 3: Process Lifecycle Management
**Goal**: Users have accurate visibility into Wine process state per bottle and can manage the full process lifecycle from the UI
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent of configuration cascade; process tracking is OS-level)
**Requirements**: PROC-01, PROC-02, PROC-03, PROC-04, PROC-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. ProcessRegistry tracks wineserver PID per WINEPREFIX, reflecting actual bottle-level process state rather than individual Wine child PIDs
  2. Orphan Wine processes are detected and the user is prompted with cleanup options
  3. Closing a bottle or quitting Whisky terminates associated Wine processes automatically via wineserver integration
  4. RunningProcessesView shows live, wineserver-aware process status with real-time updates
  5. User can force-kill individual Wine processes or all processes in a bottle from the UI
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md -- Core process types (WineProcess, ProcessKind), Wine helpers (wineserver probe, tasklist parsing, taskkill), ProcessRegistry enhancements
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md -- ProcessesViewModel with hybrid polling and full Processes page UI (Table, toolbar, filters, context menus, shutdown orchestration)
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md -- Running indicators in sidebar, startup orphan detection, pre-deletion process checks, enhanced quit behavior

### Phase 4: Graphics Configuration
**Goal**: Users can control graphics backend selection and DXVK settings per bottle and per program through a clear, tiered UI that avoids settings overload
**Depends on**: Phase 2 (graphics settings flow through EnvironmentBuilder cascade)
**Requirements**: GFXC-01, GFXC-02, GFXC-03, GFXC-04, GFXC-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can toggle between D3DMetal, DXVK, and wined3d graphics backends per bottle from the settings UI
  2. Graphics settings UI presents a Simple mode by default with an Advanced toggle for power users
  3. DXVK-specific settings (async shader compilation, HUD overlay) are configurable per bottle in Advanced mode
  4. Per-program graphics backend override is available and takes precedence over the bottle-level setting
  5. DXVK configuration file is managed through the UI with user-editable settings exposed
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md -- GraphicsBackend data model, BottleGraphicsConfig, GraphicsBackendResolver, BottleSettings integration, ProgramOverrides extension, WineEnvironment update
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md -- BackendPickerView selection cards, GraphicsConfigSection with Simple/Advanced toggle, DXVKSettingsView, dxvk.conf management, ConfigView integration

### Phase 5: Stability & Diagnostics
**Goal**: Wine error output is automatically classified so users receive actionable crash guidance instead of raw logs
**Depends on**: Phase 3 (process tracking provides context for which process generated errors)
**Requirements**: STAB-01, STAB-02, STAB-03, STAB-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. WINEDEBUG output is parsed and classified into categories: access violations, GPU errors, DLL load failures, and other patterns
  2. Known crash patterns are matched to specific remediation suggestions displayed to the user
  3. GPU-specific crash patterns (IOMFB faults, Metal compilation errors) produce targeted troubleshooting guidance
  4. Diagnostic report exports include a classified error summary section alongside the raw log
**Plans**: 5 plans
