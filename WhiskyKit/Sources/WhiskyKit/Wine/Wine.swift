/// The core interface for interacting with Wine on macOS.
///
/// The `Wine` class provides static methods for executing Wine processes, running Windows programs,
/// and managing Wine-related operations within a ``Bottle``. It handles environment configuration,
/// process management, and output streaming.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// Wine is a compatibility layer that allows Windows applications to run on macOS. This class
/// abstracts the complexity of Wine process management and provides a Swift-friendly API.
///
/// ## Running Programs
///
/// To run a Windows executable:
///
/// ```swift
/// @MainActor
/// func launchGame(at url: URL, in bottle: Bottle) async throws {
///     try await Wine.runProgram(at: url, bottle: bottle)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Wine Commands
///
/// Execute arbitrary Wine commands:
///
/// ```swift
/// @MainActor
/// func getWineVersion() async throws -> String {
///     return try await Wine.wineVersion()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// Most public methods require `@MainActor` context because they interact with ``Bottle``
/// which is main-actor isolated.
///
/// ## Topics
///
/// ### Running Programs
/// - ``runProgram(at:args:bottle:environment:)``
/// - ``runWine(_:bottle:environment:)``
/// - ``runBatchFile(url:bottle:)``
///
/// ### Wine Processes
/// - ``runWineProcess(name:args:bottle:environment:)``
/// - ``runWineserverProcess(name:args:bottle:environment:)``
///
/// ### Utilities
/// - ``wineVersion()``
/// - ``killBottle(bottle:)``
/// - ``enableDXVK(bottle:)``
/// - ``generateRunCommand(at:bottle:args:environment:)``
/// - ``generateTerminalEnvironmentCommand(bottle:)``
