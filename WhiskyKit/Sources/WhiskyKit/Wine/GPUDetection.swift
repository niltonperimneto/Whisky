/// Utilities for GPU capability detection and spoofing.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// Many game launchers perform GPU compatibility checks using DirectX and OpenGL
/// queries. On Apple Silicon Macs using Wine/CrossOver, these queries may return
/// incomplete or incorrect information, causing launchers to report "GPU not supported"
/// or display black screens.
///
/// This system addresses frankea/Whisky#41 by configuring environment variables that make
/// Wine report high-end GPU capabilities, allowing launchers to pass their checks.
///
/// ## Safety Note
///
/// GPU spoofing only affects capability reporting to launchers and DirectX queries.
/// It does **not** modify game memory or interfere with anti-cheat systems. The
/// actual rendering still uses Apple's Metal API through Wine's translation layer.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// // Apply default Apple Silicon GPU spoofing
/// let env = GPUDetection.spoofAppleSilicon()
/// // Returns environment variables reporting high-end NVIDIA GPU
/// ```
///
/// ## Topics
///
/// ### Spoofing Methods
/// - ``spoofGPU(vendor:model:)``
/// - ``spoofAppleSilicon()``
/// - ``spoofWithVendor(_:)``
///
/// ### Vendor Configuration
/// - ``GPUVendor``
