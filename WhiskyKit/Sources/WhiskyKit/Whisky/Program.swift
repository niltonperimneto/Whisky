/// Represents a Windows executable program within a ``Bottle``.
///
/// A `Program` encapsulates a Windows `.exe` file along with its configuration,
/// parsed metadata, and pin state. It provides access to program-specific settings
/// that can override bottle-level defaults.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// Programs are discovered by scanning a bottle's `drive_c` directory for executable
/// files. Each program has its own settings file for locale, environment variables,
/// and command-line arguments.
///
/// ## Running a Program
///
/// ```swift
/// @MainActor
/// func runProgram(_ program: Program) async throws {
///     let environment = program.generateEnvironment()
///     try await Wine.runProgram(
///         at: program.url,
///         args: program.settings.arguments.split(separator: " ").map(String.init),
///         bottle: program.bottle,
///         environment: environment
///     )
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - Note: The argument splitting shown above is simplified and doesn't handle
///   quoted arguments. The `arguments` string is expected to contain simple
///   space-separated values like `-windowed -nosound`.
///
/// ## Pinning Programs
///
/// Pin frequently-used programs for quick access:
///
/// ```swift
/// program.pinned = true  // Adds to bottle's pinned programs
/// ```
///
/// ## Topics
///
/// ### Creating Programs
/// - ``init(url:bottle:)``
///
/// ### Program Information
/// - ``name``
/// - ``url``
/// - ``bottle``
/// - ``peFile``
///
/// ### Configuration
/// - ``settings``
/// - ``generateEnvironment()``
///
/// ### Pin State
/// - ``pinned``
