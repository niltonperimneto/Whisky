/// Per-bottle policy for handling running processes when navigating away from a bottle.
///
/// When the user switches to a different bottle in the sidebar while Wine processes are
/// still running, this policy determines what happens:
/// - `.ask` (default): show a confirmation dialog each time
/// - `.alwaysKeepRunning`: silently keep processes running
/// - `.alwaysStop`: automatically stop all bottle processes
public enum CloseWithProcessesPolicy: String, Codable, CaseIterable, Sendable {
    /// Show confirmation dialog each time (default)
    case ask
    /// Always keep processes running without prompting
    case alwaysKeepRunning = "keepRunning"
    /// Always stop processes without prompting
    case alwaysStop = "stop"
}

/// Per-bottle policy for killing Wine processes on quit.
///
/// This allows individual bottles to override the global `killOnTerminate` behavior,
/// so users can set "always kill" for unstable bottles or "never kill" for bottles
/// running long-lived server processes.
public enum KillOnQuitPolicy: String, Codable, CaseIterable, Sendable {
    /// Use the global killOnTerminate setting (default)
    case inherit
    /// Always kill Wine processes when the bottle/app quits
    case alwaysKill = "always"
    /// Never kill Wine processes on quit
    case neverKill = "never"
}

/// Configuration settings for per-bottle cleanup and clipboard behavior.
///
/// This configuration section controls how clipboard content is handled before
/// launching Wine programs and how Wine processes are managed on quit.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// Each bottle can independently configure:
/// - Clipboard checking policy (auto, always warn, always clear, never)
/// - Clipboard size threshold for "large" content detection
/// - Kill-on-quit behavior for Wine processes
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// var config = BottleCleanupConfig()
/// config.clipboardPolicy = .alwaysClear
/// config.killOnQuit = .alwaysKill
/// ```
public struct BottleCleanupConfig: Codable, Equatable {
    /// The clipboard handling policy for this bottle.
    var clipboardPolicy: ClipboardPolicy = .auto

    /// The size threshold in bytes for considering clipboard content "large".
    ///
    /// Content above this threshold triggers the configured clipboard policy.
    /// Defaults to ``ClipboardManager/largeContentThreshold`` (10 KB).
    var clipboardThreshold: Int = ClipboardManager.largeContentThreshold

    /// The kill-on-quit policy for Wine processes in this bottle.
    var killOnQuit: KillOnQuitPolicy = .inherit

    /// The policy for handling running processes when navigating away from this bottle.
    var closeWithProcessesPolicy: CloseWithProcessesPolicy = .ask

    /// Creates a new BottleCleanupConfig with default values.
