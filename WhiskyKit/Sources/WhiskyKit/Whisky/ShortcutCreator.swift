///

///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let appURL = URL(filePath: "~/Applications/MyGame.app")
/// let target = ShortcutCreator.liveTarget(for: program.url, bottle: program.bottle)
/// let script = ShortcutCreator.liveLaunchScript(for: target)
/// try ShortcutCreator.createShortcutBundle(at: appURL, launchScript: script, name: "MyGame")
/// ```
