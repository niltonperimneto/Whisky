/// MetalFX has exactly one entry point: the DLSS API. D3DMetal links MetalFX and
/// builds its scalers, but only for a game that calls `NVSDK_NGX_D3D12_*` in
/// `nvngx.dll`, which Apple implements as `nvngx-on-metalfx.dll`. With no such
/// DLL in the tree `D3DM_ENABLE_METALFX=1` has nothing to hook, which is why
/// MetalFX could not be enabled in any bottle.
///
/// Two things make this more than a file copy:
///
/// - The bridge is a hybrid PE and unixlib module. Its `DllMain` calls
///   `__wine_init_unix_call` before anything else and returns false when that
///   fails, so the PE on its own loads as a builtin and immediately dies with
///   `ERROR_DLL_INIT_FAILED`, which reads like a corrupt DLL and is not. It needs
///   a unix half beside it, exactly like the four D3D forwarders.
/// - Builtins are keyed by their PE export name, and this one exports as
///   `nvngx.dll` rather than the filename Apple ships it under.
///
/// `nvapi64.dll`, the other half of ``nvidiaBridgeDLLNames``, deliberately stays
/// out: Chromium probes for an NVIDIA GPU, and handing it one makes it load
/// D3DMetal and take Steam's helper process down. Nothing probes for nvngx that
/// way, so the bridge itself is safe to deploy on its own.
///
/// Leaving it out is not free. A title built on NVIDIA Streamline asks NVAPI
/// about the GPU before it will consider DLSS at all, and Wine's `nvapi64`
/// exports nothing, so Streamline decides there is no NVIDIA driver and offers
/// no DLSS option. Those titles get the bridge and cannot reach it, with nothing
/// in any log to say why. A title calling NGX directly is unaffected.
///
/// Fixing that means a real `nvapi64` for the game but not for the launcher
/// helper, so a per-exe `AppDefaults` override rather than the environment every
/// child inherits. Left to a follow-up, which is why frankea/Whisky#198 stays
/// open.
