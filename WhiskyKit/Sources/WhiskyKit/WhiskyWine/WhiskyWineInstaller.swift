/// Manages the installation and updates of the WhiskyWine runtime.
///
/// `WhiskyWineInstaller` handles downloading, installing, and managing the
/// Wine runtime that Whisky uses to run Windows applications. It provides
/// version checking, update detection, and installation/uninstallation.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// WhiskyWine is a custom Wine build bundled with Whisky. This class manages
/// its lifecycle within the application's Library directory.
///
/// ## Checking Installation Status
///
/// ```swift
/// if WhiskyWineInstaller.isWhiskyWineInstalled() {
///     if let version = WhiskyWineInstaller.whiskyWineVersion() {
///         print("WhiskyWine version: \(version)")
///     }
/// } else {
///     // Prompt user to install
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Installing WhiskyWine
///
/// ```swift
/// // After downloading the tarball
/// do {
///     try WhiskyWineInstaller.install(from: downloadedTarballURL)
/// } catch {
///     // Surface the failure cause to the user
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Topics
///
/// ### File Locations
/// - ``applicationFolder``
/// - ``libraryFolder``
/// - ``binFolder``
///
/// ### Installation Status
/// - ``isWhiskyWineInstalled()``
/// - ``whiskyWineVersion()``
///
/// ### Installation Management
/// - ``install(from:)``
