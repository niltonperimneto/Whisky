> **This is the `preview` branch.** It carries Steam, DLL override and D3DMetal work that
> hasn't landed upstream yet, and ships as a separate app (`Whisky Preview.app`,
> `com.dappermint.WhiskyPreview`) that installs beside a normal Whisky rather than replacing
> it. `main` tracks [frankea/Whisky](https://github.com/frankea/Whisky) and is where upstream
> contributions are prepared — it is never released from.
>
> Lineage: [whisky-app/whisky](https://github.com/whisky-app/whisky) (archived April 9, 2025)
> → [frankea/Whisky](https://github.com/frankea/Whisky) → this fork. Not affiliated with the
> original project or getwhisky.app. Report problems with *this* build here, not upstream.

## Install

```sh
brew install --cask dappermint/tap/whisky-preview
```

Builds are ad-hoc signed and not notarized, so Gatekeeper blocks a plain double-click of the
DMG. The cask clears the quarantine flag on install, which is why it is the supported path.
There is no in-app updater; upgrade with `brew upgrade --cask whisky-preview`.

On first launch the bottle list is empty, since this app has its own bundle identifier.
**File → Import Bottles from Another Whisky…** adopts bottles from frankea's build or from the
archived original. They are referenced in place, never copied or moved, so the other build
keeps working.

## Overview

Whisky provides a clean and easy-to-use graphical wrapper for Wine built in native SwiftUI. You can make and manage bottles, install and run Windows apps and games, and unlock the full potential of your Mac with no technical knowledge required.

## System Requirements

- **CPU**: Apple Silicon (M-series chips)
- **OS**: macOS Sequoia 15.0 or later

## Installation

### Homebrew (recommended)

```sh
brew install --cask frankea/whisky/whisky
```

This taps [frankea/homebrew-whisky](https://github.com/frankea/homebrew-whisky) and installs the latest signed/notarized DMG. `brew upgrade --cask` picks up new releases.

> The default `brew install --cask whisky` still installs the **archived original** (last release April 2025) and always will until that cask is updated. Use the qualified `frankea/whisky/whisky` form to get this fork.

### Manual

1. Download the latest **[Whisky-X.Y.Z.dmg](https://github.com/frankea/Whisky/releases/latest)** (signed and notarized — Gatekeeper-approved).
2. Open the DMG and drag **Whisky.app** to **/Applications**.
3. Launch Whisky. On first run it downloads the Wine runtime (~330 MB) and sets up your default bottle.

In-app updates are delivered through Sparkle from `https://frankea.github.io/Whisky/appcast.xml`.

### Migrating from the original Whisky

The original [whisky-app/whisky](https://github.com/whisky-app/whisky) was archived on **April 9, 2025** with a final maintenance notice. If you're running it today, you're on a stale build with no path forward for new fixes. This fork picks up where the upstream left off — version `3.0.1` shipped 54 requirements covering the 10 categories of upstream issue tracking (#40–#50).

To switch:

1. Install this fork: `brew install --cask frankea/whisky/whisky` or follow the manual steps above.
2. Open it and choose **File → Migrate from the Original Whisky**. It finds the bottles the original app left in `~/Library/Containers/com.isaacmarovitz.Whisky/` and imports the ones you pick. Bottles are referenced **in place** — nothing is moved or copied — so the original app keeps working if you'd like to keep it around.
3. *(Optional)* Once you're happy, remove the original app: drag **/Applications/Whisky.app** to the Trash, or `brew uninstall --cask whisky` if you installed it via Homebrew. Your bottles stay put.

The original app uses a different bundle identifier (`com.franke.Whisky` here vs. `com.isaacmarovitz.Whisky`), which is why bottles aren't shared automatically. The old **Bottle → Export** / **File → Import Bottle** route still works if you'd rather move bottles by hand or onto another Mac. With no critical bottles, you can skip migration entirely — the new app creates a fresh bottle on first launch.

## Uninstalling

Dragging **Whisky.app** to the Trash (or `brew uninstall --cask frankea/whisky/whisky`) removes the app but leaves the Wine runtime, your bottles, and app data behind — by design, so reinstalling doesn't re-download ~330 MB or lose your bottles.

> ⚠️ **Back up your bottles first if you want to keep them.** Removing the container below deletes every bottle stored in its default location. Bottles you created in a custom folder live wherever you put them — check **Bottle → Reveal in Finder** before deleting anything.

To remove Whisky **completely**, delete the app and then these paths (all under `~/Library`):

```sh
# 1. The app itself
rm -rf "/Applications/Whisky.app"          # or: brew uninstall --cask frankea/whisky/whisky

# 2. Bottles + bottle list (default bottle location is inside this container)
rm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.franke.Whisky
rm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.franke.Whisky.WhiskyThumbnail

# 3. The Wine runtime (~330 MB) and other app support
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.franke.Whisky

# 4. Caches, logs, preferences, and saved state
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.franke.Whisky
rm -rf ~/Library/Logs/com.franke.Whisky
rm -rf ~/Library/HTTPStorages/com.franke.Whisky
rm -f  ~/Library/Preferences/com.franke.Whisky.plist
```

If you also installed bottles in a **custom location**, delete those folders too. Migrated bottles that still belong to the original app live under `~/Library/Containers/com.isaacmarovitz.Whisky` and are left untouched by the steps above.

## Telemetry (opt-in)

Whisky sends **no data by default**. During first-run setup you can opt in to
anonymous usage telemetry — a checkbox that is **off** unless you tick it, and a
toggle you can change anytime in **Settings → Privacy**.

When (and only when) enabled, Whisky sends five events covering the first-run
funnel, so the maintainer can see where new installs fail:

| Event | Properties |
| --- | --- |
| `runtime_install_started` | — |
| `runtime_install_succeeded` | — |
| `runtime_install_failed` | `reason`: one of `download_failed`, `verify_failed`, `tarball_missing`, `extract_failed`, `runtime_incomplete` |
| `first_bottle_created` | — |
| `first_program_launch_attempted` | — |

`runtime_install_started` is sent once per setup attempt; the `_succeeded` /
`_failed` events are sent per install attempt (so retries are counted). The two
`first_…` events are sent at most once per install.

No personal data, file names, paths, raw error text, or identifiers tied to you
are ever sent. Events carry a random per-install anonymous ID (reset if you opt
out). Every event Whisky can send is the list above, and all of it is declared in
one file, [`Whisky/Utils/Telemetry.swift`](Whisky/Utils/Telemetry.swift), with
every automatic-capture feature of the analytics SDK disabled and no person
profile ever created (`identify()` is never called). Each event also carries the
SDK's standard context — app and macOS version, hardware model, locale, and more;
see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full list. Like any HTTPS request,
PostHog's ingestion sees the connecting IP (GeoIP enrichment is disabled); none
of this is tied to your identity.

- **[Steam Compatibility Guide](docs/SteamCompatibility.md)** - Detailed guide for Steam on Whisky
- **[Stability Troubleshooting](docs/StabilityTroubleshooting.md)** - Diagnose crashes, freezes, reboots, and kernel panics

### Upstream issue audit

Per-issue accounting of how this fork addresses the open issues from the
archived upstream repo. Read [docs/AUDIT.md](docs/AUDIT.md) for the
methodology — including how to read the `addressed-direct` vs
`addressed-categorical` distinction and what `unverified` GameDB entries
actually mean.

### Test coverage

The Coverage badge above is scoped to the **`whiskykit` flag** — line
coverage of the framework that holds the bottle, Wine, GameDB, and
PE-parser logic, measured by `swift test --enable-code-coverage` per
[`.github/workflows/CI.yml`](.github/workflows/CI.yml). The blended
project-wide number on the [Codecov dashboard](https://codecov.io/gh/frankea/Whisky)
reads much lower because it averages in the SwiftUI app target, which
only receives best-effort UI-test coverage. Read the badge as
"WhiskyKit unit-test coverage," not full-app coverage.

WhiskyUITests gives behavioural coverage of the SwiftUI surface (toolbar,
create-bottle sheet, fixture-dependent flows). CI now runs them with
`-enableCodeCoverage YES` and uploads the resulting app-target coverage to
Codecov under a separate `whiskyapp` flag (best-effort — the upload never gates
CI). Because UI tests exercise far less of the app than the unit tests do of
WhiskyKit, expect the app-target number to read lower than the WhiskyKit badge
above.
