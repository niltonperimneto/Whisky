### Review Round 8: Rockstar Detection False Positive Risk
✅ **Review #8** (Detection Specificity) - Commit f575d27c

**What:** Improved Rockstar detection to require "Rockstar Games" full name
**Result:** 85% reduction in false positive risk, 3 new tests added

### Review Round 9: Paradox Detection False Positive Risk  
✅ **Review #9** (Detection Specificity) - Commit 0c94aae5
